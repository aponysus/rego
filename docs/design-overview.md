# Design overview

## What it is

recourse is a policy-driven resilience library for Go services. Call sites supply a stable key, policies define the retry envelope, and the executor records structured timelines and observer events so behavior is explainable in production.
<!-- Claim-ID: CLM-013 -->
<!-- Claim-ID: CLM-014 -->

## Who it is for

- Teams running multiple services that need consistent retry behavior.
- Platform or reliability engineers who want centralized policy control.
- Services that need incident-friendly, per-attempt observability.
- Teams willing to enforce low-cardinality keys and policy discipline.

## Who it is not for

- One-off scripts or small apps where manual retries are enough.
- Workloads that cannot tolerate duplicate attempts without safeguards.
- Teams that do not want to manage policy governance or key conventions.
- Situations where retries are simply the wrong tool.

## Mental model

A key chooses a policy, and the policy defines the envelope:

```
key -> policy -> executor -> attempts -> timeline/observer events
```

In more detail:

1. Call sites provide a low-cardinality policy key such as "payments.Charge".
2. A policy provider resolves the effective policy for that key.
   <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-025 -->
3. The executor runs attempts using classification, backoff, budgets, hedging, and circuit breaking as configured.
4. Observability artifacts are emitted (timeline records and observer callbacks).
   <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-013 -->
   <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-014 -->

## The operational contract

- Attempts, backoff, and timeouts are bounded by policy.
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-019 -->
- Classifiers decide whether an outcome should retry, stop, or abort.
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-023 -->
- Budgets gate attempts as backpressure.
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-010 -->
- Behavior is explainable through structured timelines and observer events.
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-013 -->
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-014 -->
- Context cancellation is respected across attempts, sleeps, and hedges.
  <!-- Claim-ID: CLM-015 -->

## Tradeoffs and organizational cost

- Keys must be stable and low-cardinality, which requires governance and review.
- Policies need ownership and careful rollout to avoid surprises.
- Backpressure and hedging can change load patterns and must be introduced intentionally.
- Remote configuration adds a control plane dependency that must be operated reliably.

## How to start

1. Pick a key convention and enforce low-cardinality rules. See [Policy keys](concepts/policy-keys.md), [Key patterns and taxonomy](concepts/key-patterns.md), and [Gotchas and safety checklist](gotchas.md).
2. Integrate via the facade in one service. See [Getting started](getting-started.md) and [Adoption guide](adoption-guide.md).
3. Capture timelines for critical calls to validate behavior. See [Observability](concepts/observability.md) and [Incident debugging](incident-debugging.md).
