# Architecture decisions

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the intent, trade-offs, and
consequences of key design choices in recourse.

## Current ADRs
- [ADR 001: Low-cardinality policy keys](../adr/001-low-cardinality-keys.md)
- [ADR 003: Policy normalization](../adr/003-policy-normalization.md)

## Create a new ADR
- Use the template: [ADR template](../adr/template.md)
- Keep decisions short and focused on the rationale and trade-offs.
